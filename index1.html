<h1>The Matrix</h1>

 <h2>About</h2>
<p><b><i>The Matrix</i> </b> an American science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis, and produced by Joel Silver. It stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano and is the first installment in <i>The Matrix</i> franchise. It depicts a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality, <i>The Matrix</i>, created by intelligent machines to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias "Neo", uncovers the truth, he "is drawn into a rebellion against the machines" along with other people who have been freed from <i>The Matrix</i>. </p>

<p><i>The Matrix</i> is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes was influenced by Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and 
wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions. The film popularized a visual effect known as "bullet time", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed, allowing the sped-up movements of certain characters to be perceived normally. While some critics have praised the film for its handling of difficult subjects, others have said the deeper themes are largely overshadowed by its action scenes.</p>

<p><i>The Matrix</i> was first released in the United States on March 31, 1999, and grossed over $460 million worldwide. It was well-received by many critics and won four Academy Awards, as well as other accolades, including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards. <i>The Matrix</i> was praised for its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value. The film is considered to be among the best science fiction films of all time, and was added to the National Film Registry for preservation in 2012. The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels in 2003,<b> The Matrix Reloaded</b> and<b> The Matrix Revolutions</b>, which were also written and directed by the Wachowskis, and produced by Joel Silver. <i>The Matrix</i> franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films.</p>

<h2><b>Influences</b></h2>
<p><i>The Matrix</i> draws from and alludes to numerous cinematic and literary works, and concepts from mythology, religion and philosophy, including the ideas of Buddhism, Christianity, Gnosticism, Hinduism, and Judaism.<p>

<h3><b> Film and television</b></h3>
<p> pods in which the machines keep humans have been compared to images in <b>Metropolis</b>, and the work of M. C. Escher. and can be seen in<b> Welcome to Paradox </b> 4 "News from D Street" from a 1986 short story of the same name by Andrew Weiner which aired on September 7, 1998 on the SYFY Channel and has a remarkably similar concept. In this episode the hero is unaware he is living in virtual reality until he is told so by "the code man" who created the simulation and enters it knowingly. The Wachowskis have described Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey as a formative cinematic influence, and as a major inspiration on the visual style they aimed for when making <i>The Matrix</i>. Reviewers have also commented on similarities between <i>The Matrix</i> and other late-1990s films such as Strange Days, Dark City, and The Truman Show. The similarity of the film's central concept to a device in the long-running series Doctor Who has also been noted. As in the film, <i>The Matrix</i> of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial The Deadly Assassin) is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality. The action scenes of <i>The Matrix</i> were also strongly influenced by live-action films such as those of director John Woo. The martial arts sequences were inspired by Fist of Legend, a critically acclaimed 1995 martial arts film starring Jet Li. The fight scenes in Fist of Legend led to the hiring of Yuen as fight choreographer.</p>

<p> Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation such as Ninja Scroll and Akira. Director Mamoru Oshii's 1995 animated film Ghost in the Shell was a particularly strong influence; producer Joel Silver has stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions for The Matrix by showing him that anime and saying, "We wanna do that for real". Mitsuhisa Ishikawa of Production I.G, which produced Ghost in the Shell, noted that the anime's high-quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowskis. He also commented, "... cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. I'd imagine that The Matrix is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios." He stated that since Ghost in the Shell had gained recognition in America, the Wachowskis used it as a "promotional tool".</p>

<h3><b>Literary works</b></h3>
<p> <i>The Matrix</i>, a copy of Jean Baudrillard's philosophical work Simulacra and Simulation, which was published in French in 1981, is visible on-screen as "the book used to conceal disks", and Morpheus quotes the phrase "desert of the real" from it. "The book was required reading for" the actors prior to filming. However, Baudrillard himself said that <i>The Matrix</i> misunderstands and distorts his work. Some interpreters of <i>The Matrix</i> mention Baudrillard's philosophy to support their claim "that the [film] is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries." "The influence of [Baudrillard] was brought to the public's attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel." In addition to Baudrillard, the Wachowskis were also significantly influenced by Kevin Kelly's Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, and Dylan Evans’s ideas on evolutionary psychology. The film makes several references to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Comparisons have also been made to Grant Morrison's comic series The Invisibles, with Morrison describing it in 2011 as "(it) seemed to me (to be) my own combination of ideas enacted on the screen". Comparisons have also been made between <i>The Matrix</i> and the books of Carlos Castaneda.</p>

<p> Matrix belongs to the cyberpunk genre of science fiction, and draws from earlier works in the genre such as the 1984 novel Neuromancer by William Gibson. For example, the film's use of the term "Matrix" is adopted from Gibson's novel,though L. P. Davies had already used the term "Matrix" fifteen years earlier for a similar concept in his 1969 novel <b>The White Room </b>("It had been tried in the States some years earlier, but their 'matrix' as they called it hadn't been strong enough to hold the fictional character in place"). After watching <i>The Matrix</i>, Gibson commented that the way that the film's creators had drawn from existing cyberpunk works was "exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis" he had relied upon in his own writing; however, he noted that the film's Gnostic themes distinguished it from Neuromancer, and believed that <i>The Matrix</i> was thematically closer to the work of science fiction author Philip K. Dick, particularly Dick's speculative Exegesis. Other writers have also commented on the similarities between <i>The Matrix</i> and Dick's work; one example of such influence is a Philip K. Dick's 1977 conference, in which he stated: "We are living in a computer-programmed reality, and the only clue we have to it is when some variable is changed, and some alteration in our reality occurs."</p>
<h3><b>Philosophy</b></h3>
<p>It has been suggested by philosopher William Irwin that the idea of the "Matrix" – a generated reality invented by malicious machines – is an allusion to Descartes' "First Meditation", and his idea of an evil demon. The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us. The same premise can be found in Hilary Putnam's brain in a vat scenario proposed in the 1980s. A connection between the premise of <i>The Matrix</i> and Plato's Allegory of the Cave has also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato's theory of Forms, which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception<p>

<p> philosophy of Immanuel Kant has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within <i>The Matrix</i> interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his <b>Critique of Pure Reason</b> that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of <i>The Matrix</i>, which was designed as a human utopia, a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, "it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost." The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived <i>The Matrix</i> in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. According to William Irwin this is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content, so that they would remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans were not easy to make content.</p>
<h3><b>Religion and mythology</b></h3>
<p>Andrew Godoski sees allusions to Christ, including Neo's "virgin birth", his doubt in himself, the prophecy of his coming, along with many other Christian references.Amongst these possible allusions, it is suggested that the name of the character Trinity refers to Christianity's doctrine of the Trinity. It has also been noted that the character Morpheus paraphrases the Chinese taoist philosopher Zhuangzi when he asks Neo, "Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you weren't able to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference from the real world and the dream world?"</p>

<p>Matrixism is a fan-based religion created as "the matrix religion".</p>

<h3><b>Transgender themes</b></h3>
<p> after the release of The Matrix, both the Wachowskis came out as transgender women, and some have seen transgender themes in the film. The red pill has been compared with red estrogen pills. Morpheus's description of The Matrix giving you a sense that something is fundamentally wrong, "like a splinter in your mind", has been compared to gender dysphoria. Also, in the original script, Switch was a woman in The Matrix and a man in the real world, but this idea was ultimately dropped. In a 2016 GLAAD Media Awards speech, Lilly Wachowski said "There’s a critical eye being cast back on Lana and I's [sic] work through the lens of our transness. This is a cool thing because it's an excellent reminder that art is never static."</p>

<h3><b>Legacy</b></h3>
<p><i>The Matrix</i> had a strong effect on action filmmaking in Hollywood. The film's incorporation of wire fu techniques, including the involvement of fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping and other personnel with a background in Hong Kong action cinema, affected the approaches to fight scenes taken by subsequent Hollywood action films, moving them towards more Eastern approaches. The success of <i>The Matrix</i> created high demand for those choreographers and their techniques from other filmmakers, who wanted fights of similar sophistication: for example, wire work was employed in <b>X-Men </b>(2000) and <b>'s Angels</b>(2000), and Yuen Woo-ping's brother Yuen Cheung-Yan was choreographer on <b>Daredevil</b> (2003). The Matrix's Asian approach to action scenes also created an audience for Asian action films such as <b>Chourching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</b>(2000) that they might not otherwise have had.</p>

<p>Following <i>The Matrix</i>, films made abundant use of slow-motion, spinning cameras, and, often, the bullet time effect of a character freezing or slowing down and the camera dollying around them. The ability to slow down time enough to distinguish the motion of bullets was used as a central gameplay mechanic of several video games, including <b>Max Payne</b>, in which the feature was explicitly referred to as "bullet time". It was also the defining game mechanic of the game Superhot and its sequels.</p>

<p>The Matrix's signature special effect, and other aspects of the film, have been parodied numerous times, in comedy films such as Deuce Bigalow: <br>
    <b>- Male Gigolo</b> (1999),<b> Scary Movie</b> (2000),<b> Shrek</b>(2001), <b>Kung Pow! Enter the Fist </b>(2002), <b>Lastikman</b> (2003); <br>
    <b>- Marx Reloaded </b>in which the relationship between Neo and Morpheus is represented as an imaginary encounter between Karl Marx and Leon Trotsky; <br>
    - in video games such as<b> Conker's Bad Fur Day.</b></p>

<p>It also inspired films featuring a black-clad hero, a sexy yet deadly heroine, and bullets ripping slowly through the air: <br>
    <b>- Charlie's Angels</b> (2000) featuring Cameron Diaz floating through the air while the cameras flo-mo around her;<br> 
   <b> - Equilibrium</b> (2002), starring Christian Bale, whose character wore long black leather coats like Reeves' Neo; <br>
   <b> - Night Watch </b>(2004), a Russian megahit heavily influenced by The Matrix and directed by Timur Bekmambetov, who later made Wanted (2008), which also features bullets ripping through air; <br>
    <b>- Inception </b>(2010), which centers on a team of sharply dressed rogues who enter a wildly malleable alternate reality by "wiring in". </p>

<p>The original<b> Tron</b> (1982) paved the way for <i>The Matrix</i>, and <i>The Matrix</i>, in turn, inspired Disney to make its own Matrix with a Tron sequel, <b>Tron: Legacy </b>(2010). Also, the film's lobby shootout sequence was recreated in the 2002 Indian action comedy Awara Paagal Deewana.</p>

<p> Moss asserted that prior to being cast in <i>The Matrix</i>, she had "no career". It launched Moss into international recognition and transformed her career; in a New York Daily News interview, she stated, "The Matrix gave me so many opportunities. Everything I've done since then has been because of that experience. It gave me so much". The film also created one of the most devoted movie fan-followings since<b> Star Wars</b>. The combined success of the Matrix trilogy, the Lord of the Rings films and <b>the Star Wars </b> made Hollywood interested in creating trilogies. Stephen Dowling from the BBC noted that The Matrix's success in taking complex philosophical ideas and presenting them in ways palatable for impressionable minds might be its most influential aspect.</p>

<p><i>The Matrix</i> was also influential for its impact on superhero films. John Kenneth Muir in The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television called the film a "revolutionary" reimagination of movie visuals, paving the way for the visuals of later superhero films, and credits it with helping to "make comic-book superheroes hip" and effectively demonstrating the concept of "faster than a speeding bullet" with its bullet time effect. Adam Sternbergh of Vulture.com credits <i>The Matrix</i> with reinventing and setting the template for modern superhero blockbusters, and inspiring the superhero renaissance in the early 21st century.<p>

<p>In 2001, <i>The Matrix</i> placed 66th in the American Film Institute's "100 Years...100 Thrills" list. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly called <i>The Matrix</i> the best science-fiction piece of media for the past 25 years. In 2009, the film was ranked 39th on Empire's reader-, actor- and critic-voted list of "The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time". <i>The Matrix</i> was voted as the fourth best sci-fi film in the 2011 list Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time, based on a poll conducted by ABC and People. In 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being "culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant."<p>
